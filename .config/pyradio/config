# PyRadio Configuration File

# Player selection
# This is the eqivelant to the -u , --use-player command line parameter
# Specify the player to use with PyRadio, or the player detection order
# Example:
#   player = vlc
# or
#   player = vlc,mpv, mplayer
player = mpv, mplayer, vlc

# Default playlist
# This is the playlist to open if none is specified
# You can specify full path to CSV file, or if the playlist is in the config
# directory, playlist name (filename without extension or playlist number (as
# reported by -ls command line option)
#
# Default value: stations
default_playlist = stations

# Default station
# This is the equivalent to the -p , --play command line parameter
# The station number within the default playlist to play.Value is 1..number
# of stations, "-1" or "False" means no auto play, "0" or "Random" means play
# a random station
#
# Default value: False
default_station = False

# Enable mouse
# If this options is enabled, the mouse can be used to scroll the playlist,
# start playback, etc. Mouse integration is highly terminal dependent, that's
# why it is disabled by default.
#
# Default value: False
enable_mouse = False

# Recordings directory
# This is the firectory where recorded files will be saved
#
# Please do not change this parameter manually in the user's configuration file
# as it will cause problems. Use the in program Window instead:
# (Config / General Options / Recordings dir)
#
# Default value: default
recording_dir = default

# Resource Opener
# This is a Linux (et al) only parameter. It has no effect on Windows or MacOS.
# A Resource Opener is a program used to open files passed to it as arguments.
# PyRadio will use it to open either directories or HTML files.
# Default value is "auto", in which case, PyRadio will try to use xdg-open,
# gio, mimeopen, mimeo or handlr, in that order of detection.  If none if found,
# the requested file will simply not open.
# To set a custom Opener, insert its name (either absolute path to its executable
# or its name, if it is in your PATH), followed by any parameter required,
# for example: "/usr/bin/gio open", "mimeopen -n".

# Desktop notifications
# If this option is enabled, a Desktop notification will be displayed using the
# notification daemon / service. If enabled but no notification is displayed,
# please refer to
# https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio/desktop-notification.md

#   -1: disabled
#    0: enabled (no repetition)
#    x: enabled and repeat every x seconds

# Default value: -1

# Some stations will advertise a station icon (logo).

# if this option is True.
# #
# Default value: True

# Cached Station Icons Handling
# If use_station_incon is True, stations' icons will be cached in the logos folder.
# If this option is True (the default), all files under this folder will be
# deleted at program exit. Otherwise, all downloaded logos will remain in the
# folder for future use.
#
# Default value: True
remove_station_icons = True

# Connection timeout
# PyRadio will wait for this number of seconds to get a station/server message
# indicating that playback has actually started. If this does not happen
# (within this number of seconds after the connection is initiated), PyRadio
# will consider the station unreachable, and display the "Failed to connect to:
# [station]" message.
#
# Valid values: 5 - 60, 0 disables check
# Default value: 10
connection_timeout = 10

# Force http connections
# Most radio stations use plain old http protocol to broadcast, but some of
# them use https. If this is enabled,  all connections will use http; results
# depend on the combination of station/player.

# Default value: False

# Default theme
# Hard coded themes:
#   dark (default) (8 colors)
#   light (8 colors)

# This is applicable for user themes only!

# Default value = dark

# Transparency setting
# If False, theme colors will be used.
# If True and a compositor is running, the stations' window background will be
# transparent. If True and a compositor is not running, the terminal's
# background color will be used.
#
# Default value: False
use_transparency = True

# Always obey config Transparency setting
# Most themes will either be transparent of opaque by default. This means that
# these themes will never be allowed to change the transparency setting within
# PyRadio. Enabling this option will make all themes to behave as if their
# "transparency" option is set to 2 (Obey config setting).
#
# Default value: False
force_transparency = True

# Calculated color factor
# This is to produce Secondary Windows background color. A value of 0 disables
# it, otherwise it is the factor to change (lighten or darken) the base color.
# For more info, please refer to

# Valid values: 0-0.2
# Default value: 0

# Virtual Console, or on a terminal that does not support color change.

# Specify whether you will be asked to confirm every station deletion action

# Remote Control server
# A simple http server that can accept remote connections and pass commands
# to PyRadio
#
# Valid values:
#   remote_control_server_ip: localhost, LAN, lan
#   remote_control_server_port: 1025-65535
